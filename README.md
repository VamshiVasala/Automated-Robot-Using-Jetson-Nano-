# 🤖 Automated Robot Using Jetson Nano

An intelligent autonomous robot built using the **Jetson Nano**, capable of real-time object detection, SLAM-based navigation, and conversational AI — all enhanced with stereo vision and 3D depth perception.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This robot is designed to perceive and interact with its environment using AI-powered perception and control systems. It combines computer vision, SLAM, object tracking, and obstacle avoidance to autonomously move towards specified targets in real time.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Object Tracking** using optimized **YOLOv5n.trt**
- 🗺️ **Visual SLAM** via **VINS-Fusion** for real-time localization and mapping
- 👀 **Stereo Camera** support for accurate 3D **depth perception**
- 🤖 **Motor Control** for wheel and neck movement
- 🧭 **Obstacle Avoidance** for safe path navigation
- 🧠 **Conversational AI Interface** for user-friendly interaction
- 📷 **Camera Calibration** for improved vision accuracy
- 🚶‍♂️ Walks autonomously toward the **target object**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Detects Objects** in real-time using YOLOv5n accelerated by TensorRT.
2. **Estimates Depth** using stereo vision for accurate distance measurement.
3. **Maps the Environment** using VINS-Fusion SLAM to navigate dynamically.
4. **Moves Toward Target** when a specified object is detected.
5. **Avoids Obstacles** while navigating using sensor input.
6. **Engages in Conversation** with users through friendly conversational AI.
